2020/01/21 14:28 (drawing stereographic projection picture) this is
going to be a terrible picture so let's expunge this from the
historical record

2020/01/28 13:22 (talking about how conformality is remarkable, throws
papers by accident) i may throw something at you at some point but you will
deserve it

2020/1/28 13:45 (proof that f' = 0 => f' is constant, proof for
imaginary part) you pretend you're in rome, and you convert all these
u's to v's

2020/1/28 13:52 cauchy riemann equations are really important--you
know how you know that?  they're named

2020/1/30 13:22 (on example: log |z| is harmonic) if someone hands you
a function and says it's harmonic you can tell whether they're

2020/1/30 14:13 (observe that ... is harmonic) good news is, you've
already done it; bad news is, you've done it in the future--that's
homework 3
