\begin{exercise}
	Is it possible to express \(f(z) = z^3\) as a power series centered
  at the point \(z_0 = i\)?  If not, explain why.  If so, what is the
  radius of convergence?

  \begin{solution}

  \end{solution}

\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
	Find all \(z\) for which the infinite series
  \[
		\sum_{n=1}^ \infty \frac{1}{n^2} \exp \prn*{\frac{nz}{z-2}}
  \]
	converges.

  \begin{solution}

  \end{solution}

\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
	Consider the power series \(f(z) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty z^{n!}\).
	\begin{problems}
  \item What is the radius of convergence \(R\) for this series?

    \begin{solution}

    \end{solution}

  \item As we have seen, certain power series can be
    \emph{analytically continued} beyond their disk of convergence.
    By (a), the function \(f(z)\) is analytic on the open disk
    \(\Omega = \{ z : \abs z < R\}\).  We consider here whether or not
    \(f\) can be analytically continued to some larger region.  To be
    more specific, does there exist a region \(\Omega'\), properly
    containing \(\Omega\), and an analytic function
    \(g \colon \Omega' \to \CC\) such that \(f(z) = g(z)\) for all
    \(z \in \Omega\)?  Justify your answer.\footnote{Hint: Investigate
      what happens as you approach the circle \(\abs z = R\).}

    \begin{solution}

    \end{solution}

	\end{problems}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}[optional]
  Let \(f \colon \DD \to \CC\) be an injective analytic function such
  that \(f(0) = 0\) and \(f'(0) = 1\).  Assuming that \(f\) enjoys a
  power series expansion \(f(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n z^n\) for
  \(z \in \DD\), prove that \(\abs{a_n} \le n\) for \(n \ge 0\).
